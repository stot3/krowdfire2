      <h1 class="heading-76"><strong>Overview of the Stripe Connection Process For Campaign Funding</strong></h1>
      <div class="w-richtext">
        <p>Stripe is the credit card payment processor used by <strong>KROWDFIRE</strong> to collect donations made to your Campaign and then pay those monies to you.  Stripe has its own rules and you must abide by them if you want your donations to be paid to you.  Some of their rules exist to conform to IRS reporting requirements that Stripe must follow.  Completing this Stripe Connection process successfully is mandatory in order to have a <strong>KROWDFIRE</strong> Campaign – so treat it carefully and seriously.</p>
        <p>Stripe requires ALL <strong>KROWDFIRE</strong> Campaigns to have one of their “Merchant Accounts” regardless of the true nature and purpose of your Campaign.  And this requires that you have an EIN number from the IRS (this is NOT the same as your Social Security number) before you can acquire your Stripe account and have it connected to <strong>KROWDFIRE</strong>.</p>
        <p>If you are conducting a Campaign to raise money for a business, estate or trust that already has an EIN number, then you can proceed directly to our &quot;Funding&quot; section and the part connecting that EIN number to Stripe as you create your Stripe account.  And if, by chance, you already have a Stripe account, you can proceed directly to connecting it to <strong>KROWDFIRE</strong>.</p>
        <p>If you do not have an EIN number, then your first step in the &quot;Funding&quot; Campaign Creation section must be to acquire one.  You cannot proceed without it.  In the Funding section, you will be invited to &quot;Click here&quot; to acquire your EIN number directly - and immediately - from the IRS.  And you will be taken directly to their website for this process.</p>
        <p>Once you are on the IRS page for EIN creation, this is how you should proceed.</p>
        <p>First, you will be asked to pick a “legal structure”.  If you will conduct your Campaign as a business that is already an LLC or Corporation, pick one of those options.  If your Campaign is either an Estate or Trust, pick the appropriate option.  BUT if your Campaign is a “business” and not yet an LLC or Corporation – or if it is for some “personal project” - pick “Sole Proprietor”.  (This option will likely be the proper choice for most <strong>KROWDFIRE </strong>Campaigns.)</p>
        <p>After choosing “Sole Proprietor”, choose “banking purpose” for the next choice you must make.  Then you will be asked to provide personal information as the person seeking this EIN number as a “Sole Proprietor”.  Here you will be asked for your personal Social Security number.  (This is NOT the same as the EIN that will be created and assigned to you.)</p>
        <p>When asked what will be the name for your EIN – and if it is a business, estate or trust - you can use that name.  But if your Campaign will be a “personal project”, then use your name – followed by the word “Sponsor”. (It would look like this:  John Doe – Sponsor) This may seem counterintuitive, but you have to work with the provided template as best you can.</p>
        <p>Once you have your EIN number, you can proceed to the next step in the “Funding” section of your Campaign Creation by “clicking” to proceed with your Stripe Connection and following that process.  Once you are properly connected to Stripe, you will be ready to receive donations and have them sent directly to your Bank Account.</p>
